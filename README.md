## CNN in C
-----------------
- Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in C from scratch is quite a complex task because C doesn't have built-in support for tensors, automatic differentiation, or matrix operations like Python + PyTorch/TensorFlow. But it's a great way to deeply understand how CNNs work under the hood.

- Here’s a simple CNN in C that can take a 2D image (like a 5x5 grayscale image) and apply a single convolutional filter, followed by ReLU and pooling. This example is for educational purposes only and does not include training or backpropagation—just a forward pass.
